SiteSonar PHP4 Website Monitoring Service (simple Pingdom)

These are the original source files for a simple Pingdom clone project that I concieved in high school (before Pingdom was heard about). The startup was sold in 2008 to a Texas-based firm, and died shortly after.  I've uploaded the files as a demonstration of it's completion, although I'm not particularly proud of the code quality. But cut me some slack, it was 2008, and I was 14 years old.
